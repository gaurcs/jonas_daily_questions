Given 2 rectangles, find out whether the rectangles have intersecting areas.
Note: If the rectangles share and edge, that does not count as intersecting.
You will be given the bottom left point and the top right point of the rectangle.

Ex:
input: [[(0,0), (1,4)][(1,4)(2,5)]]
output: false

input: [[(0,1), (2,3)], [(1,1),(3,5)]]
output: true


Expansion: Given an array of rectangles, return true if at least n rectangles have intersecting areas.
It is fine if Rectangles A,B intersect and B,C intersect, but A,C don't intersect. It will still count.

What is the runtime and memory usage?
